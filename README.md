# WhatsApp To Discord

WhatsAppToDiscord is a Discord bot that uses WhatsApp Web as a bridge between Discord and WhatsApp. It is built on top of [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js) and [Baileys](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys) libraries.

### Features

- Supports media (Image, Video, Audio, Document, Stickers) and reactions!
- Allows whitelisting, so you can choose what to see on Discord
- Allows usage of WhatsApp through the Discord overlay
- It uses less memory as it doesn't simulate a browser
- Open Source, you can see, modify, and run your version of the bot!
- Self-hosted, so your data never leaves your computer
- Updated the .sh script to run on an easy [Linux](https://github.com/Stradios/WhatsAppToDiscord/blob/main/Linux_install_whatsapp_to_discord.sh) install
